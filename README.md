# Alternative Pong
## A singleplayer pong with only one game mode 

(I have not tried the game in a while. Don't know how well it works)

The goal is to defend against oncomming balls from passing you, by reflecting them with the paddle. You have two lifes.

Has scaleable resolution, V-sync, fullscreen/windowed mode and saves your highscore in appdata 

Made with pygame.
